                    <br>
                    <h4>
                        I first heard of Genshin Impact at some point last year. I was scrolling through some game news stories and I kept seeing its name pop up. In every article it was being compared to The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. Most articles pointed to the presence of a stamina gauge as well as climbing and swimming. Obviously this felt a little silly to me as games can have similar features in them. I brushed off the articles and mostly just kept playing the games I currently had, I didn't see actual game play of the game until this year.

                    <h3>How I Started Playing</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h4>
                        I first saw game play of Genshin Impact when I was watching Nepiki stream it one day. If you don't know Nepiki he is a fellow blogger that also streams on Twitch. While I watched him play, I asked some questions to learn more about the game. I was pretty hesitant to try it at first since it's free to play, but to get new charterers you have to use summons which is a gacha system. I decided to download it and try it out the next day since it was free. It was pretty easy to get into with controls that were easy to understand.

                    <h3>The Story So Far</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h4>The game has a pretty good story that I look forward to getting further into. To summarize without spoiling too much your character is searching for their brother or sister, this is based in the gender you choose. Along your journey you get caught up in different events that happen in each of the different nations that you will travel to. The story isn't finished yet since the game is still updating.
                    </h4>
                    <h3>Game Play</h3>
                    <h4>
                        The game play is pretty simple to understand. The game is an open-world RPG with optional multiplayer. You can play the game alone, which is what I choose to do. Each character has a normal attack, an elemental skill, and an elemental burst. The elemental skill changes based on the character and has a brief recharge period after using it. The elemental burst is like an ultimate attack that requires a gauge to build up for it to be used.
                    </h4>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Do I Recommend it?</h3>
                    <h4>
                        I recommend at least giving it a try to see how you feel about it. One thing I should mention is that the game isn't finished. Right now it's currently like a live service game where new content keeps being put into the game. I think it being compared to The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is doing this game a disservice. There is a lot to this game such as character leveling, weapon leveling, and artifact leveling. Each improve stats of your charterers in different ways. There is also a lot to do in the game if you're just starting out. Plenty of puzzles to solve and locations to discover.
